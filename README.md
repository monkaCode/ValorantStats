## How to begin
First of all you must make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpNyLf-vzPHh88zD2xacgQFGOTUvunAH3pKrY9RcR6Y/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets Document</a>.
Then you can edit the player names in the first Sheet of the Spreadsheet (Info). Just write the names from your team into the cells Info!C3:C12.

Thats was it for setting the Google Spreadsheet up. Now you can manually type in the stats into the Sheet called Stats or go on and show this video down below.
